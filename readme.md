# Genetic Algorithm

Inspiration taken from medium article titled ["Introduction to genetic algorithms in c# with a real application"](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-in-c-with-a-real-application-72c3fc42bdf9) by Ahmed Fouad

The original code snippets used the Accord.NET Framework which has been archived and not ported to .NET Core.  
The original library code can be viewed [here](https://github.com/accord-net/framework/tree/development/Sources/Accord.Genetic)

For this project I am using [GeneticSharp](https://github.com/giacomelli/GeneticSharp) 

The goal is to learn and experiment with genetic algorithms with the end goal being able to successfully incorporate the algorithms into other projects to solve scheduling conflicts.
